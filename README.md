# Real-Time Naming Convention

Just type it like this:
```
def some function(some parameter, another parameter):
  some variable = 42
  return

class some class:
  def some method(self, some parameter, another parameter):
    self.some field = 42
```
As soon as you type the above, you will get:
```python
def some_function(some_parameter, another_parameter):
  some_variable = 42
  return

class SomeClass:
  def some_method(self, some_parameter, another_parameter):
    self.some_field = 42
```
